By spreading the cost of the installation out over an agreed payment term, your business can have the advantages of solar power from day one without the drain on cash flow. Todae Solar will work with your organisation and find the right finance partner to enable you to install solar power"

      title: "POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT:",
      description: "Secure your company's energy costs with long term hedging against future energy price volatility with a Todae Solar PPA. A Solar PPA allows you to install solar power without any upfront capital investment â€“ with no significant effect on cash flow. A Solar PPA means you are buying the solar electricity produced by the system, rather than buying the system itself. This means that you only pay for what the system produces, and you usually pay less than what it would cost to buy the same electricity from the grid."
